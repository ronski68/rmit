My first experience with IT was when I was given an Apple 2+ computer for christmas which I used for gaming and programming. During my schooling teachers would ask me for assistance with their computers. After School I did a diploma in Software Development and gained a job as a junior programmer. From there I moved into network support and help desk then onto managing larger networks and systems.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My choice of RMIT for doing this degree was based on brand recognition, I have worked with people in the past who have done their degree at RMIT and have spoken very highly of the course and the institution. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By completing this degree I am expecting to learn best practice theory and fill in my missing skills and knowledge to make me a better IT professional.

Reading the ideal candidate description conveys that they are looking for an all rounder who is able to operate with minimal assistance and is capable of building the systems which are required as they currently don&rsquo;t exist. This makes the job very attractive for me as I enjoy operating in a fluid and dynamic environment where you have to be capable and actively building solutions.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desc of skills and experience</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This job is looking for a person with the ability to work without supervision and interact with management and stakeholders on a professional level with the skills to influence both groups. There is no mention of a formal qualification which implies that the company is looking for someone with more practical experience such as Office 365 and an established history of working in a similar role.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My Skills etc</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My thirty years of experience in the IT industry means that I have covered all of the minimum requirements and the experience required. My best fit to the job requirements is in the Ideal candidate section where I have experience with building IT systems and creating solutions for businesses without an already established IT department or infrastructure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Plan to obtain requirements</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While I already have the experience and skills for the job, I believe that the addition of a degree would ensure that my application would be moved to above any similar qualified and experienced applicant who doesn&rsquo;t have a degree. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Personal Profile</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Online tests</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Result of the tests</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What they mean to me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These tests mean nothing to me. I place them in the same category as Horoscopes. If it was possible to create a good team based on categorising people into 16 boxes using a questionnaire then there would only be successful teams.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Behaviour in a team</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I have no confidence in these tests I don&rsquo;t believe that the results will affect my behaviour while in a team.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Forming a team</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I stated previously if there was a questionnaire that would allow you to create a perfect team then it would be used and everyone would use it. I would have confidence if there was any scientific testing of these tests versus a simple random selection. At best I don&rsquo;t think it will be any more harmful than a random selection.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Project Idea</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A scheduling assistant for a retail shop</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overview (100)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A website, portal and/or app which would enable a store manager to specify the opening hours, shift times and staffing levels for the store with particular focus on any skill requirements of staff for each shift (Cook, Prep, Shift Manager). Shift would be able to be created and managed graphically by the manager with staff notified of their shifts and able to accept, swap or decline shifts based on their availability.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Motivation (100)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Most retail stores struggle with ensuring that their staff know what shifts they are working and ensuring that the right people with the right skills are scheduled for each shift. A very large amount of the management of any retail store and in particular a food store is spent creating and managing shifts and staff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Description (500)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A website which will allow owners, managers and shift managers to manage their staff and their shift staffing levels to ensure that there are the right number of people with the right skills allocated to each shift. The website should be able to track the experience of staff and managers, their skills and qualifications and produce reports that can be used either directly or manually to update payroll systems and costings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Store Managers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The manager of a store would be able to control the opening hours including holidays, staffing hours, shift numbers, shift budgets and shift staffing levels for the store. An overview of the future staffing and costings for each shift would enable balancing of shift costs against anticipated store turnover with the manager able to simply budget using a graphical drag and drop or automated system to create the shifts. If the store manager allows it then the shift managers could be allocated the ability to manage their shifts directly allowing them to do the shift building and budgeting. Store managers would also create staff and promote staff to shift managers, cooks and authorise any skills and qualifications unless they have alloced this to shift managers. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shift Managers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The manager of a particular shift would be able to drag and drop staffing to ensure a balanced shift taking into account staffing levels, skill requirements and financial budgeting of the shift. The shift manager would finalise their shift and the store manager would then be able to either approve or have the shift automatically approved. When a shift is completed the shift manager may make any notes regarding the shift and possibly add turnover totals to the shift before finalising the shift where the staff experience would be updated and the store manager sent an update of the shift. Shift Managers would be able to mix and match staffing to ensure that not only is there enough staff but also to spread the experience loading. This will ensure there is no accidental all inexperienced cook placed on a shift and that a trainee in one skill is placed with the best experienced staff available. &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Staff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Each staff member would be created by a store of shift manager and then manage their own contact details and information such as holidays, skills, qualifications and availability with their manager able to review and authorise relevant details. The staff member would receive notification of any shifts they have been allocated to and approve or decline the shift based on their availability. The staff members would be able to give up a shift to a similarly skilled and qualified other staff member with the shift manager and or store owner, manager updated about the change and give the right to accept or veto. Staff would be sent push reminders regarding their shift allocation when the shift is finalised and a specific period of time prior to the start of their shift. Staff would be able to make their shift available based on a private one to one offer to their friend or friends or put their shift up for whomever wants it. Maybe on a first come first served or on a manager picks from available bidders option.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tools &amp; Tech (100)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A database stored in the cloud and integrated with a website used as a portal would be the minimum requirements of this system. My preference would be an HTML5 website which could display on a monitor, tablet or mobile with the format being changed to reflect the available real estate. The security would have to be 2 factor with either sms or email used to verify changes made at all levels. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Skills required (100)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Relational database development skills would be necessary with SQL being a leading contender for the database. HTML5 and PHP skills would be the minimum for the web development with probable scripting needed to make the interactivity work.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Outcome (100)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Revolutionising the the currently manual and basically crappy shift and store staffing of retail food businesses would allow free up the time of managers and allow them to focus on the management of their store rather than micro managing their staff. The previous staff history record for a new employee would also ensure that the experience and skills learnt in one store would transfer to a new employee. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
